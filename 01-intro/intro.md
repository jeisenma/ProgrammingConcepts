## Lab: Critique an Interactive Piece (15 minutes)
 - Find an interactive experience you think is interesting (can be a product, piece of software, art installation, or anything with input/output and a human-in-the-loop).
 - Places to look: [Mozilla Demo Studio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/), [Matt's list](http://accad.osu.edu/~mlewis/Jitter/Class/DataRemappingExamples.html), [Kinect Hacks](http://www.kinecthacks.com/), [Alan's list](http://accad.osu.edu/~aprice/courses/BVE/examples.html), [OpenProcessing](http://www.openprocessing.org/browse/), [the Processing gallery](http://processing.org/exhibition/)
 - Briefly describe what it does and how it works.
 - Analyze the piece with respect to the 7 points covered in the presentation (slide 8).
 - What does it do well?  What could be improved?
 - E-mail me your critique, and we'll also present our critiques to the class.
