## Discussion
- [Scratch][] basics
- Basic geometry review

## Programming Concepts
- Sequencing

## Examples
You can load these by downloading them, then in your Scratch tab, go to "File" > "Upload from your computer", and select the file you just downloaded.

- [Draw Square][]
- [Draw Square w/ a Loop][]
- [Cat bounce][]
- [Cat on mouse][]

## Lab
- Draw a polgyon 
	- Use a variable "sides" to set the number of sides
	- Can you draw a circle?
	- Bonus: see if you can make each polygon have approximately the same area  (hint: use ratios -- no need to bust out any algebraic manipulation)
