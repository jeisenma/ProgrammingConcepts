## Assignment
- Write a python program that draws a radially symmetric turtle drawing.
- Save it to a file called radialSymmetry.py and submit it on Carmen. (4 points total)
	- use at least one function (1 point)
	- use at least one loop (1 point)
	- use an 'if' to make a decision based on the current iteration of a loop (1 point)
	- provide interesting variables at the top for controlling the look of your drawing (explain these with comments!) (1 point)
