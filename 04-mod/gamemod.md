## Discussion
- Intro to [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) 
- [Hacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(hobbyist))/[Mod-ing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming))

## Programming Concepts
- Iterative development (small changes)
- Syntax

## Lab: GameMod
- You will be modifying this game to make something entirely different. (the [original GameMod workshop](http://www.trsp.net/teaching/gamemod/))
- Download and unzip the [GameMod][] files
- Open them up in jEdit (or [on the playground][], make small changes, run, repeat!
- If you get into trouble after a change and don't know how to fix it, just Ctrl-Z until things are happy
- At the end of class, we'll have a mod show

## Assignment
- Submit your finished mod(s) on Carmen (3 points)
- Record a video of you interacting with your favorite mod and submit it along with your mod (1 point)
	1. While your sketch is running click on the screen then hold down the 'g' key for the duration you want to record.
	2. Open Quicktime, go to File > Open Image Sequence
	3. Browse to your sketch directory, then to the "saved" sub-directory.  Your images should be there.  Open the first one.
	4. When Quicktime has finished loading all the images in the sequence, go to File > Export and export it as a Quicktime Movie with H.264 encoding.
	5. This should create an MOV file which you can upload to the Carmen dropbox.
	6. Make sure your movie is 30 seconds or less and has a resolution of 400x400
