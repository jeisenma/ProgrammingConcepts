# Animation: Bringing things to life with motion
--------------------------------

## Discussion
- types of animation:
	- Prerecorded -- based on numbers or images
	- Procedural -- driven by math, physics, or rules
- animation principles
- special considerations for interaction
	- ease-in/ease-out
	- overlapping 

## Examples
 - [Animated Sprite][] ([images](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jtpmd2znxyqhq99/data.zip?dl=1))
 - [Recorded Motion][]
 - [Making Waves][]
 - [Bouncing ball][]
 - [Springs][]

## Lab
- Noisy Worm - Create a worm out of a series of circles.  Move the head of the worm with a noise function.  Make the rest of the worm's body follow the head by remembering previous head positions.

## Reading
- [John Lasseter's paper on the 12 Principles of Animation](http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/animation/character_animation/principles/prin_trad_anim.htm)
- Optional further reading:
	- [The Uses and Abuses of Cartoon Style in Animation](http://journal.animationstudies.org/leslie-bishko-the-uses-and-abuses-of-cartoon-style-in-animation/)
	- [Computer Animation: Algorithms and Techniques](http://books.google.com/books?id=DudZtbOD2gMC&lpg=PP1&dq=0124158420&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false)

## Assignments
- Interactive Animation Sketch
	- make a thing that responds to mouse/keyboard input with appealing animation
	- you can make your animation from prerecorded keyframes or procedural rules (or both!)
	- you are encouraged to make this a building block for your data visualization project (we'll encapsulate this and make multiples of it next time)
- Save it to a file called animation.py and submit it on Carmen. (10 points)
