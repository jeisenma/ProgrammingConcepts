## Assignment
- Paint tool - Create a basic paint tool in processing-py.  It should enable the user to:
	- (2 points) Draw in red, green, or blue. Use the 'r', 'g', and 'b' keys to switch colors.
	- (2 points) Clear the screen with the delete key OR the backspace key.
	- (4 points) Toggle between brush mode and polgyon mode with the spacebar. (Polygon mode connects the dots between mouse clicks.)
	- (2 points) Save the image to a file called "myPainting.png" the hard drive using [the save() function](http://processing.org/reference/save_.html).
- Submit your py file on Carmen (10 points)
- You can receive up to 3 extra credit points for adding an extra creative feature based on loops, arrays or the constrain function.
