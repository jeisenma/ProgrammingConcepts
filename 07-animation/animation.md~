# Animation: bringing things to life with motion
--------------------------------

## Discussion
- types of animation:
	- Prerecorded -- based on numbers or images
	- Procedural -- driven by math, physics, or rules
- animation principles
- special considerations for interaction
	- ease-in/ease-out
	- overlapping 
- Perlin noise vs. randomness

## Programming Concepts
- Functions and parameters
- Loops and lists (again!)

## Examples
 - [Animated Sprite][] ([data](pcad.py?page=07-animation/animatedSprite/data.zip))
 - [Recorded Motion][]
 - [Making Waves][]
 - [Bouncing ball][]
 - [Springs][]

## Lab
- Noisy Worm - Create a worm out of a series of circles.  Move the head of the worm with a noise function.  Make the rest of the worm's body follow the head by remembering previous head positions.

## Assignments
- Interactive Animation Sketch
	- make your monster respond to mouse/keyboard input with appealing animation (1 point)
	- you can use prerecorded keyframes or procedural rules... or both! (1 point)
	- use at least one custom function with at least one parameter to update the monster's pose  (2 points)
- Save it to a file called animation.py and submit it on Carmen. (4 points total)
