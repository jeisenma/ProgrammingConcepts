# Encapsulation: object oriented programming
--------------------------------

## Discussion
- properties and actions
- constructors
- what is "self"?
- generating stuff

## Programming Concepts
- lists! (again)
- dictionaries
- encapsulation (aka Object-Oriented Programming)
- custom modules (again!)

## Examples
- [rotating squares][]
- [snowmen][]
- [animated sprite][] ([data](pcad.py?page=08-oop/animatedSpriteClass/data.zip))
- [bouncy balls][]
- [shape gallery][]

## Lab
- parametric [snow goons](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060317210361/candh/images/3/35/Attack_of_the_Deranged_Mutant_Killer_Monster_Snow_Goons.jpg)

## Reading
- [LPTHW](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) 40-42 

## Assignment
- Encapsulate your monster drawing and animation 
	- Create some intuitive properties for your monster class so that it can be controlled parameters passed into the constructor (1 point)
	- Generate a family of monsters with as much interesting diversity as you can muster by mapping random values to the above parameters (2 points)
	- Allow the user to generate a new set of random monsters by pressing the space bar (1 point)
- Save it to a file called generative.py and submit it on Carmen. (4 points total)
- If you dig this generative thing, you might want to try to take it a step further by evolving monsters using a genetic algorithm. (see [Shiffman's tutorial on GAs][])
