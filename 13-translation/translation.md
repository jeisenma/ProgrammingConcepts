# Translation: becoming a polyglot
--------------------------------

## Making the transfer
- the concepts are almost entirely the same
- the syntax will be different (e.g. "int x = 3;" instead of "x=3")
- you may have to type more stuff
	- ![java vs python](pcad.py?page=13-translation/javaVsPython_moreTyping.png)

## Examples 
- Core Concepts:
	- variable declaration
	- math operators
	- for loops
	- while loops
	- boolean operators
	- conditions 
	- working with arrays (lists)
	- encapsulation
	- importing
- Processing-isms (processing.js works by translating java processing so I'll only show java and python here)
	- setup/draw framework
	- mouse functions
	- keyboard functions

## Fun places to work with other languages
- [Processing!](http://processing.org)  (Java)
- [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com) (JavaScript)

## Assignment
- convert one of your previous sketches from python to Java
- convert one of the java Processsing examples to python
