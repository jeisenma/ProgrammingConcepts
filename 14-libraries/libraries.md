# Libraries: letting other people do the hard work
--------------------------------

## Discussion
- review of importing modules in python
- the Java-processing equivalent
- \* doesn't work yet, you have to import things by name (see examples)

## Programming Concepts
- libraries
- data streams
 
## Installing libraries to processing.py
- Download and unzip the processing library you want (or use the Processing Library Manager to get it into your sketchbook)
- Then copy the library folder into this folder:
	- PROCESSING.PY_INSTALLATION_FOLDER/libraries/processing/
- You can be certain you've copied the right folder from the library by making sure it's got a 'library' folder inside of it (one level down).  This 'library' folder should have one or more .jar files in it.

## Examples
- [Synthesizing sound with Minim][]	
- [Scrubbing through a movie][] ([data](pcad.py?page=14-libraries/data/transit.mov))



[Synthesizing sound with Minim]: pcad.py?page=14-libraries/minim.py
[Scrubbing through a movie]: pcad.py?page=14-libraries/movie.py
