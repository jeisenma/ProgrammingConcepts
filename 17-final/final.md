# Final Project
--------------------------------

## The big idea
- Your project should be related to your areas of interest/research.
- It should help you explore, investigate, or communicate content from your discipline.
- Your project idea might be too big to complete in the allotted week and a half, so try to identify a significant component that will be doable in the given time frame.
- If your project necessitates you leaving the world of Processing, I can guide you, but it's up to you to do all the leg work.  Make sure you plan for the extra time it will take to become familiar with your new environment.

## The Nitty Gritty
### Project proposal (4 points - 1 point each)
- Project Description: who is your audience, what is your story and why, a list of user interactions
- References: data sources (must read data from a file or a server), images, videos, audio, articles, etc
- Wireframe drawing: shows roughly what a screenshot of your final interface might look like (use a storyboard if the interface will change significantly)
- Tasklist: a detailed list of what you have to do and when each task will be finished
    
### Project materials (16 points)
- Submit:
	- Code
	- Data/images/movies/other assets
	- Reference your sources in the comments of your code
	- If your code doesn't run in the Playground, please submit a video of you interacting with your sketch.
- Rubric: (4 points each)
	- ease of interaction - can someone sit down and just figure it out?
	- completion - did you finish what you laid out in your proposal?
	- sufficient complexity - did your project require more than just adapting an existing example?
	- creativity - is it just a version of another interactive work or is there originality here?
		
### Final presentation (10 points)
- You will have exactly 5 minutes.
- The format your presentation should follow:
	- quick high-level demo of your sketch to provide us with some context for what you are doing
	- a brief visual presentation (e.g. 5-ish slides or images) that descibes
		- why you chose this project concept
		- what challenges you encountered and how you overcame them
		- any interesting notes about your process or things you discovered along the way
		- your visuals should not include ANY code... unless you want to show super clever snippets
	- a final demonstration of your sketch
- Create a sub-directory named after you in this directory
    Y:\\Courses\\2012-2013\\AC5102_Eisenmann_SU13\\
- Load your files into that sub-directory BEFORE class starts.  We will use it to minimize time between presentations.
